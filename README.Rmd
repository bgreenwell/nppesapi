### What is nppesapi?

**nppesapi** queries the NPPES API with an R wrapper. It allows systems to access 
  NPPES public data in real-time, rather than through batched uploads. The API 
  retrieves data from NPPES daily. 

For help with the **nppesapi** R-package, there is a vignette available in the /vignettes folder.
