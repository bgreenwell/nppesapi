What is nppesapi?

### What is nppesapi?

**nppesapi** queries the NPPES API with an R wrapper. It allows systems to access 
  NPPES public data in real-time, rather than through batched uploads. The API 
  retrieves data from NPPES daily. 

For help with the **nppesapi** R-package, there (will be) a vignette available in the /vignettes folder.
  
# Installation

The package can be installed with

    devtools::install_github("dgarmat/nppesapi")

After installation, the package can be loaded into R.

    library(nppesapi)

# Using nppesapi

The main function in the **nppesapi** package is `nppes_api()`.  

```
nppes_api("city=dayton")
nppes_api("number=1124021324")
```
